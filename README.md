## Introduction

Putrid Pomodoros is a revolutionary web application (that nobody has ever thought of before) that aggregates information about movies and displays all of it in an aesethetically pleasing interface.

In this current iteration of the product, we have added the following functionality:

- API Data Fetching

- Cypress End-to-End Testing

We Cypress testing to ensure that our product behaves the way we want it to in the final production version deployed on Heroku.
